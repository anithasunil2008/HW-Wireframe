				About Me:
			</h2>
			<p> 
				Welcome to Anitha's pottery website. I have five year's of experience in the pottery field. For two year's I have learnt pottery at "Red Door pottery" studio in Maine. Elaine was my teacher. 
				Elaine Xenelis Fuller began pottery classes at the Worcester Craft Center in 1978. Falling in love with clay work she continued her studies with classes, workshops and at Wesleyan University under Mary Risley where she received a Masters in Liberal Studies in 1983.
				Here is the link to her pottery studio.

						Pottery Creation Techniques:
					</h1>
					<p>
						 Hand-built and wheel thrown represent two basic techniques for creating pottery. Within those techniques there are also different ways of forming the clay.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Hand-Built Pottery:
					</h2>
					<p>	
						Hand-built pottery, the first form of pottery, allows individuals to form clay without the use of a potter's wheel. Hand-Built Techniques are pinch pot, coil pot, slab pot.
					</p>
				   <div id="pot1">
						<h3>
							Pinch Pot:
						</h3>
						<p>
							Made by kneading the clay and pressing it into the shape of a bowl, cup, dish, or pot
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="pot2">
						<h3>
							Coil Pot:
						</h3>
						<p>
							The clay is made into long, round clips coiled and stacked to form other shapes.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="pot3">
						<h3>
							Slab Pot:
						</h3>
						<p>
							Slabs of clay are used to form clay boxes or other geometric shapes; can be combined with other hand-built techniques to make more advanced shapes
						</p>
					</div>
			
					<h2>
					Wheel-Thrown Pottery:
					</h2>
					<p>
					Wheel-thrown pottery uses a more difficult technique than hand-built pottery and requires the use of a potter's wheel, as well as 	specific knowledge about how to use the wheel, such as the need to center the clay before working it.
